jobs:

  # This action is split into three jobs:
  # - Building the source distribution
  # - Building the wheels for the distribution
  # - Uploading the artifacts to PyPI package
  # The first and second job run in parallel.
  # The uploading jos needs to have the other two finished without error.

  build_sdist:

    # First the source distribution is done on ubuntu. This is not related
    # to any operating system, so we could do it on the default os.
