SEP

[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/kbarbary/sep.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kbarbary/sep)

C library for Source Extraction and Photometry

*"... [it's] an SEP: Somebody Else's Problem."  
"Oh, good. I can relax then."*

[Source Extractor](http://www.astromatic.net/software/sextractor) is
great, but sometimes you want to use a few of the pieces from it
without running the entire executable. This library implements a few
of the algorithms used in SExtractor as stand-alone pieces. So far
this includes:

* global background estimation
* source detection
* circular aperture photometry

In the future, the library may also include other functions
related to photometry that are not in Source Extractor.

SEP is designed both to be used in C programs and to be wrapped in
higher-level languages such as Python or Julia. To make the latter
easier, SEP has minimal dependencies.

Build and install distributed versions
--------------------------------------

To build and install to your OS's standard location:

```
./configure
make
make install
```

If you are using the development version via the git repository
you have to generate the ``configure`` file once by running
```
./bootstrap.sh
```

To emit warnings and treat warnings as errors run make as:

```
make CFLAGS='-O2 -g -Wall -Werror'
```

To run the tests before installing, do:

```
make check
```

Timing results from the tests are in `test/runtests.log`.

Build and install for developers
--------------------------------

If you are using a developer version from github, you will need to
first do `./bootstrap.sh` before the above commands. This requires
`autoconf` and `libtool`.

If you wish to build against the SEP static library without
installing, you will find it in `src/.libs/libsep.a` after
running make.

API

_Check the header file `sep.h` for the authoritative API._

### Background estimation

```c
int sep_makeback(float *im, float *mask, int w, int h,
                 int bw, int bh, float maskthresh, int fbx, int fby,
                 float fthresh, sepbackmap **bkmap);
```
*create a representation of the image background and its variance*

Note that the returned pointer must be freed by calling
`sep_freeback()`.

* `im` : image data  
* `mask` : mask data (ignored if NULL)  
* `w`, `h` : width and height of image and variance arrays
  (width is the fast axis)  
* `bw`, `bh` : box size (width, height) used for estimating background
  [default in SExtractor: 64]  
* `maskthresh` : pixels with `mask > maskthresh` are ignored.  
* `fbx`, `fby` : Filter size in x and y directions used in median-filtering
  background meshes [SE default: 3]  
* `fthresh` : Threshold used in filtering [SE default: 0.0]
* `bkmap` : Returned background map.

Returns: `status` error code (0 if OK).

```c
void sep_backline(sepbackmap *bkmap, int y, float *line);
```

*Evaluate the background using bicubic spline interpolation at line y*

* `bkmap` : pointer to background map
* `y` : index of the line  
* `line` : array of size `bkmap->imnx` (image width)

```c
void sep_backarray(sepbackmap *bkmap, float *arr);
```

*Evaluate the background using bicubic spline interpolation for the entire
image*

* `bkmap` : pointer to background map   
* `arr` : array of size `bkmap->imnx * bkmap->imny` (original image pixels)

```c
void sep_backrmsline(sepbackmap *bkmap, int y, float *line);
```

*same as `backline()` but for background RMS*

```c
void sep_backrmsarray(sepbackmap *bkmap, float *arr);
```

*same as `backarray()` but for background RMS*

```c
float sep_backpixlinear(sepbackmap *bkmap, int x, int y);
```

*return background at position x,y using linear interpolation between
background map vertices*

```c
void sep_freeback(sepbackmap *bkmap);
```

*free memory associated with a background map*

### Source detection

```c
int sep_extract(float *im, float *var, int w, int h,
                float thresh, int minarea,
                float *conv, int convw, int convh,
                int deblend_nthresh, double deblend_mincont,
                int clean_flag, double clean_param,
                int *nobj, sepobj **objects);
```

*Detect objects in an image*

* `im`: image array
* `var`: variance array (can be NULL), used for thresholding
* `w`, `h`: width and height of arrays (width is fast axis)
* `thresh`: detection threshold [SE default: 1.5*(background sigma)]
* `minarea`: Minimum number of pixels for detection [SE default: 5] 
* `conv`: convolution array (can be NULL) [SE default: {1 2 1 2 4 2 1 2 1}] 
* `convw`, `convh`: size of convolution array [SE default: 3, 3]
* `deblend_nthresh`: Number of thresholds in deblending [SE default: 32]
* `deblend_mincont`: Deblending parameter [SE default: 0.005]
* `clean_flag`: Perform cleaning? (1 = YES) [SE default: 1]
* `clean_param`: Cleaning parameter [SE default: 1.0]

If `var` is NULL, `thresh` is taken to be be an absolute threshold in ADU.
Otherwise, `thresh` is taken to be sigma and a variable threshold of
`thresh * sqrt(var)` is calculated for each pixel.

Return values:

* `nobj` : number of objects detected
* `objects` : array of `sepobj` structs of length `nobj`

An `sepobj` struct holds a collection of parameters characterizing the
size, shape, and brightness of the object. It also contains an array
of ints giving the pixels belonging to the object. Note that these arrays
must eventually be `free`d. 


### Aperture photometry

```c
void sep_apercirc(PIXTYPE *im, PIXTYPE *var, int w, int h,
                  PIXTYPE gain, PIXTYPE varthresh,
		  float cx, float cy, float r,int subpix,
		  float *flux, float *fluxerr, short *flag);
```

*Sum values in a circular aperture (subpixel method)*

* `im` : data array
* `var` : variance array (treated as zero if NULL)
* `w`, `h` : array dimensions in x, y
* `gain` : gain, used in adding poisson noise (not added if zero)
* `varthresh` : variance threshold.
* `cx`, `cy`, `r` : center and radius of aperture
* `subpix` : number of subpixels used
* `flux`, `fluxerr`, `flag` : results
